          <p><i>Your Last Heist</i> is a cooperative, collaborative, multi-stage heist game. You are playing the role of a uniquely skilled career criminal who works with other criminals to pull meticulously-planned heists.  You must quietly traverse the a series of buildings to steal items and free prisoners, all while dealing with obstacles like closing gates, guards, locks, sensors, and cameras.<p>

          <h2>Never forget who you are.</h2>
          <p>Everyone has their own special part to play in a heist. You must use your character's abilities to their fullest extent to maximize your team's chance of success. Precise coordination is critical.</p>

          <p>The Burglar is a quick mover. The Angry Locksmith is an efficient picker. The Thug literally thinks with his fists. The Script Kiddie supports other players. The Lookout avoids upcoming disasters. The Street Urchin is cerebral and mobile. Who will you be?</p>

          <p>The game comes with 18 characters, 6 Amateurs and 12 pros. As you progress through scenarios, your character will be promoted, gaining better abilities while maintaining prior abilities.</p>

          <p>Every character gets two Skills, and those Skills get leveled-up over time. The game has 6 Amateur Skills and 12 Pro skills.<p>

          <h2>An ever-changing board</h2>
          <p><i>Your Last Heist</i> uses a hex tile modular board that can be rebuilt for all kinds of situations.</p>

          <p>The tiles are also carefully designed so that you don't have to sort the tiles - you simply build. Building a single map take 4-6 minutes, according to our tests.</p>

          <p>The game comes with 16 carefully-crafted boards. Free boards and scenarios (campaigns) will posted on this site regularly (see <a href="/extras">Extras</a>). </p>

          <p>And, in keeping with our philosophy of being open and for makers, the modular board means you can design your own heists easily. Try it out and don't be afraid to share!</p>

          <h2>No taking turns.</h2>
          <p>Gameplay is simultaneous and collaborative. Instead of taking turns, everyone choose an Action, which is a a set of "sub-actions" (üí°‚ûúüì∑üîçüëäüîì). Those sub-actions can be done in any order, and can be interleaved with the sub-actions of other players. This makes for a chatty atmosphere at the table. And no more waiting for your turn!</p>

          <p>The scenarios are designed so that, most of the time, you only need to be collaborating with one other player. So not everything needs to be cleared by everyone, and there's plenty of crosstalk. This style of play is unique, efficient, keeps everyone engaged, and mitigates "alpha dog" syndrome (where one person dictates every move).</p>

        <p>Each heist is a chapter in a broader, emerging storyline. The narrative drives your team's objectives and uniquely shapes the constraints of the heist. Decisions you make early in your campaign will impact later heists. The characters in these stories are all part of one universe, with recurring characters and themes.</p>

        <p>The campaigns are all replayable. The heists themselves have random elements, and you can customize characters and skills to your liking.</p>

        <p>A single heist takes 35-45 minutes, and the game comes with a document that allows you to "save" your game. Some campaigns are short enough to be played in one evening (e.g. <i>The Fall Guys</i>), while our longest campaigns are six chapters long (e.g. <i>The Venetian Swap</i>), suitable for two or three play sessions.</p>
