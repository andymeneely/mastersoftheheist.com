      <p><i>Your Last Heist</i> is a cooperative, collaborative, multi-stage heist game for the tabletop. You are a uniquely skilled career criminal who works with other criminals to pull meticulously-planned heists. You must quietly traverse a series of buildings to steal items and free prisoners, all while dealing with obstacles like closing gates, guards, locks, sensors, and cameras.<p>

      <h2>Do your part and we'll be fine.</h2>
      <p>Everyone has their own special part to play in a heist. You must use your character's unique abilities to their fullest extent to maximize your team's chance of success. Precise coordination is critical.</p>

      <p>The Burglar is a quick mover. The Angry Locksmith is an efficient picker. The Thug literally thinks with his fists. The Script Kiddie supports other players. The Lookout avoids upcoming disasters. The Street Urchin is cerebral and mobile. Who will you be?</p>

      <p>The game comes with 18 characters, 6 Amateurs and 12 pros. As you progress through scenarios, your character will be promoted, gaining better abilities while maintaining prior abilities.</p>

      <h2>Refine your Skills.</h2>
      <p>Skills give you the most powerful moves available. But you won't always get what you need.</p>
      <p>Your die roll will determine which actions are available. Didn't roll what you needed? Use your Ideasüí° to alter your die roll. But be careful! You'll also need those Ideasüí° to Escape later on. </p>
      <p>Every character gets two Skills, and those Skills get leveled-up over time. The game has 6 Amateur Skills and 12 Pro skills.<p>

      <h2>Every mark is different.</h2>
      <p><i>Your Last Heist</i> uses a hex tile modular board that can be rebuilt for all kinds of situations.</p>

      <p>The tiles are also carefully designed so that you don't sort the tiles - you simply build.</p>

      <p>The game comes with 16 carefully-crafted boards. Free boards and scenarios (campaigns) will posted on this site regularly (see <a href="/extras">Extras</a>). </p>

      <p>And, in keeping with our philosophy of being open and for makers, the modular board means you can design your own heists easily. Try it out and don't be afraid to share!</p>

      <h2>No taking turns.</h2>
      <p>Gameplay is simultaneous and collaborative. Instead of taking turns, everyone choose an Action, which is a set of "sub-actions" (üí°‚ûúüì∑üîçüëäüîì). Those sub-actions can be done in any order, and can be interleaved with the sub-actions of other players. This makes for a chatty atmosphere at the table. And no more waiting for your turn!</p>

      <p>The scenarios are designed so that, most of the time, you only need to be collaborating with one other player. So not everything needs to be cleared by everyone, and there's plenty of crosstalk. This style of play is unique, efficient, keeps everyone engaged, and mitigates "alpha dog" syndrome (where one person dictates every move).</p>

      <h2>Never forget who you are.</h2>
      <p>Between heists, you will have the opportunity to promote (level-up) your character from Amateur to Pro. Every Amateur character can become one of two Pro characters.</p>
      <p>Pro characters maintain the spirit of their Amateur predecessors, while providing richer, unique strategies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Script Kiddie becomes either a Hacktivist or a Black Hat</li>
        <li>Lookout becomes either a Watchman or an Inside Man</li>
        <li>Street Urchin becomes either a Grifter or a Mastermind</li>
        <li>Burglar becomes either a Grease Man or a Sewer Rat</li>
        <li>Angry Locksmith becomes either a Safecracker or a Tunneler</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Skill cards follow a similar level-up structure, allowing for vast combinations of Skills and Characters.</p>

      <h2>Plan to improvise.</h2>
      <p>Each heist starts with a quick planning phase where you determine where your character will go. Some characters are very mobile and can move deep within the board. Other characters can't move very far. You'll need to mark off the board which hex tiles you can move to, according to the plan you discussed and agreed upon as a team.</p>

      <p>And things never go according to the plan.</p>

      <p>Most tiles have a Security chit that is unknown until you arrive there. Guards slow you down. Cameras raise alerts. Locks prevent passage. Each of these can be handled, but take time... time you may or may not have. </p>

      <h2>Stay quiet, if you can.</h2>
      <p>The actions you take will have a cost: noise. Noise is the inevitable consequence of break-in. At first, not much will happen. But beware! Noises add up quickly.</p>

      <p>Noises turn into Alerts. As the Alert bar increases, worse and worse events will hit your team. Reinforcements will re-lock and un-disable cameras. Guards will escape being subdued. A Gate might close and eliminate an entire tile from the board - perhaps cutting off critical escape routes.</p>

      <h2>Getting out is the hard part.</h2>
      <p>When the alarm goes off, your team needs to get out. Ignore your plans - just get to the nearest exit. Locks are still impassable. Escaping a Guard require two Escape Moves. Cameras don't matter.</p>

      <p>You'll need to pick your escape route and determine, perhaps with a single die roll, if you can get out. Having extra Ideasüí° are critical at this stage - they give you one Escape Move each.</p>

      <p>In this example, suppose Blue has üí°üí° (two Ideas). He needs five Escape moves to get out. Thus, he needs to roll a 3 or higher to get out successfully.</p>

      <p>Red, sadly, is blocked from reaching any exit because of the Locks. He is Busted and the player must choose a new Amateur character with Amateur Skills for the next heist.</p>

      <p>This means that your team can have characters get Busted, but you still complete your objective. Your team would move on to the next chapter with a different team. Many interesting outcomes are possible.</p>

    <p>Each heist is a chapter in a broader, emerging storyline. The narrative drives your team's objectives and uniquely shapes the constraints of the heist. Decisions you make early in your campaign will impact later heists. Every story is part of one universe, with recurring characters and themes.</p>

    <p>The campaigns are all replayable. Since locks, cameras, and guards are randomized, a single heist can play very differently each time. Campaigns come with a suggested set of Character+Skill combinations, but you can customize each play through to try out different strategies. And you can make different choices in the campaigns that lead to further replayability.</p>

    <p>A single heist takes 35-45 minutes, and the game comes with a document that allows you to "save" your game. Some campaigns are short enough to be played in one evening (e.g. <i>The Fall Guys</i>), while our longest campaigns are six chapters long (e.g. <i>The Venetian Swap</i>), suitable for two or three play sessions. Each campaign provides a rich set of storylines and character arcs without a long-term time investment.</p>
