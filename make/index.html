      <h2 class="text-center">Maker Edition</h2>
      <p>I am creating a <i>Your Last Heist: Maker Edition</i> for those who are willing to make some of the components themselves. We will provide a cheaper, minimal Maker Edition of the game on a separate TheGameCrafter storefront. This smaller edition will include the cards, dice, and other parts that are difficult to make.<p>

      <p>If you have access to a laser cutter at your friendly local maker space - and you'd be surprised how many are out there - you'll be able to download the plans and just cut out the pieces in wood. This will likely be cheaper than buying the fully-printed version, and will be made of wood! I'm currently working on this myself and I'm very excited about this prospect.<p>

      <p>The Maker edition of the game is what is currently under development (as of September 2017). You can find the files here in <a href="https://github.com/andymeneely/project-timber-wolf/tree/master/maker">the repository</a>.</p>

      <p>Below are some photos of the latest!</p>
