      <p>This project has been submitted to the <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/contests/gamehole-gauntlet">Gamehole Gauntlet Challenge</a> hosted by TheGameCrafter. Community voting is currently taking place!! Voting closes September 4. To advance past the opening round of the contest, I need your votes!</p>
      <p>To vote for the game, you'll need to have some "Crafter Points", which are obtained by purchasing something from The Game Crafter. If you have not purchased anything from The Game Crafter. Minimally, you would need to create an account at <a href="http://www.thegamecrafter.com">TheGameCrafter.com</a> and buy $4 worth of Crafter Points. Or, you can just purchase a game and get points that way.</p>
      <p>Once released, I intend to keep a color version on TheGameCrafter. The storefront will be <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/your-last-heist1">here</a>.</p>
