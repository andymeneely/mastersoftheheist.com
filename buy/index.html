      <p><i>Your Last Heist</i> is currently in beta and is not available for purchase from a publisher or self-publishing site... yet!</p>

      <p>I am taking commissions to build you your own copy of the <a href="/maker">Maker Edition</a>. A few of my playtesters have taken me up on this already. You can find me on <a href="github.com/andymeneely/">my GitHub</a> to contact me for requests and a quote.</p>
