      <h2>Vote for this game!</h2>
      <p>This project will be submitted to the <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/contests/gamehole-gauntlet">Gamehole Gauntlet Challenge</a> hosted by TheGameCrafter. Submissions are due August 29, 2016 and community voting will take place immediately after. To advance past the opening round of the contest, we need votes!</p>
      <p>To vote for the game, you'll need to have some "Crafter Points", which are obtained by purchasing something from The Game Crafter. If you have not purchased anything from The Game Crafter. Minimally, you would need to create an account at <a href="http://www.thegamecrafter.com">TheGameCrafter.com</a> and buy $4 worth of Crafter Points. Or, you can just purchase a game and get points that way!</p>
      <p>Once released, I intend to keep a color version on TheGameCrafter. The storefront will be <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/your-last-heist1">here</a>.</p>
